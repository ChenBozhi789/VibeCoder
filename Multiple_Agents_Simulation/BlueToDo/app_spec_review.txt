AppSpec Review for BlueToDo

Source PRD: C:\Users\cbz\Desktop\VibeCoder\VibeCoder\Multiple_Agents_Simulation\BlueToDo\PRD.md
Generated AppSpec: C:\Users\cbz\Desktop\VibeCoder\VibeCoder\Multiple_Agents_Simulation\BlueToDo\app_spec.json

Summary of verification:
- Core functional requirements:
  - Add/edit tasks (title required, notes optional/planned): COVERED in features array as "add-edit-tasks (title required, notes optional/planned)".
  - Delete tasks + undo: COVERED as "undo-delete".
  - Empty state with CTA: COVERED as "empty-state with CTA".
- Data model:
  - PRD defines Task fields (id, title, notes optional, created_at, updated_at). NOT EXPLICIT in app_spec.json — recommend adding a data_model section with the Task schema.
- Validation rules:
  - Title required: PARTIALLY COVERED by "validation-title-required" feature. Recommend explicit validation section describing rules and limits (e.g., optional 100-char soft limit).
- Non-functional requirements:
  - Offline support & local persistence: PARTIALLY COVERED as "offline-support" and "localStorage persistence". Recommend clarifying storage mechanism (localStorage, IndexedDB, filesystem) and offline behavior.
  - Fast/minimal UI: COVERED as "fast-minimal-ui".
- Extras (Backup/Export): COVERED as "export-csv-json (manual backup/export)".
- Success Criteria: NOT EXPLICIT as structured section. The description in the PRD exists but app_spec.json should include a success_criteria section listing the items from PRD (create/edit/delete, persistence, validation, empty state, undo delete).

Terminology consistency:
- Feature names are consistent in spirit. Some small differences in phrasing (e.g., "localStorage persistence" vs PRD phrase "data is stored locally and persisted between sessions"). Recommend unifying wording: use "local persistence (localStorage/IndexedDB)" or specify mechanism.

Missing/Incomplete app_spec.json sections (per checklist requirement):
- Overview (present as description but could be expanded)
- Functional Requirements (not separated; features array exists but recommend structured functional_requirements)
- Non-Functional Requirements (not separated)
- UI/UX Design (not present beyond features/description)
- Data Model (MISSING)
- Validation & Edge Cases (MISSING as structured section)
- Storage & Persistence (partially present in features but should be a section)
- Implementation Plan (MISSING)
- QA Checklist (MISSING)
- Success Criteria (MISSING as structured section)
- Future Enhancements (MISSING; PRD lists extras and reminders optional)

Recommended next steps:
1) Confirm two PRD questions:
   - Notes in v1? Reply with 1) Keep Notes optional (later) or 2) Include Notes in v1.
   - Reminders in v1? Reply with 1) Not in v1 or 2) Include reminders in v1.
2) I will generate an expanded app_spec.json (JSON) that includes all required sections above, the full Task data model, explicit validation rules, and Success Criteria. I will save it to the existing spec path (app_spec.json). Let me know choices from step (1) and whether to proceed.
