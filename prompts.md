Created react-simple-spa template using https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite

---


Let's create a smolagent tool that creates an app from a template. How might this work? Please use the `context7` tool to find documentation for smolagents and their tools.

Do we need to parameterize our template in `templates/react-simple-spa`?


After we create our app, how can we iterate on it and change it? What is the best way to enable an agent to edit files without burning through tokens?

Then ultrathink about how to implement this and write your plan to a file like `plans/2025_08_21_plan_name.md`

The entire `gemini-cli` github repo has been downloaded to the `gemini-cli/` folder.

Please inspect the `packages/core/src/tools` directory to understand how gemini-cli makes efficient edits to source files. Then ultrathink about how to implement similar tools for smolagents and write your plan to `/plans/2025_08_21_smolagent_edit_tools.md`

Then update `/plans/2025_08_21_smolagent_template_generator.md` to focus on generating apps from templates only.

---

Let's skip tree-sitter for now. Let's also skip:

  - File content caching system
  - Token usage analytics


  Let's make the linter and compile checks simple tools that the agent can use to check its own work, instead of creating
  compound tools like `edit_with_lint_check()`.

  Let's also prefer python unit, file, or package scoping instead of unecessary class-based approach. Let's keep it simple and
  easy to read. Please update `plans/2025_08_21_smolagent_edit_tools.md` based on the feedback.

---

Great! Now let's update our plans/2025_08_21_smolagent_template_generator.md to be much more simple and elegant. We just want to be able to copy a template into the `results/` dir and set some parameters for it. Then we're use the editing tools described in plans/2025_08_21_smolagent_edit_tools.md to actually modify the template. Let's keep:

```
@tool
def generate_app_from_template(app_spec: dict) -> str:
    """Generate complete React app from template and specifications."""
```

And let's define the app_spec as a pydantic model so we know what it accepts.

Please update `plans/2025_08_21_smolagent_template_generator.md` to reflect this simplified approach.

---

Please review `plans/2025_08_21_smolagent_template_generator.md` and `plans/2025_08_21_smolagent_edit_tools.md` and then review our existing code. Then ultrathink about how to implement this in our codebase. Do you have any questions before wget started?

---

Use the `context7` tool to lookup `/openai/openai-python` and then evaluate how to implement it.

---

Great! Now please write PROGRESS.md with progress and design decsisions. We'll share this with the next developer to pick up the code.
