# User Requirements for NewApp

App Name: NewApp

1. Purpose & Audience
- Purpose: A simple to-do app that runs in the laptop browser.
- Audience: People who want a minimal task list application for their laptop.

2. Core Features & Tasks
- Basic CRUD for tasks: create, read (view), update (edit), delete tasks.
- Keep the app minimal and easy to use.

3. Design & UI Preferences
- Minimal, clean layout (simple typography, limited colors, uncluttered).
- Focus on usability rather than visual flair.

4. Data to Store
Each Task should include at least:
- title (string) — required (user confirmed title only is needed)

(Implementation notes: the app may store internal fields such as id, timestamps, or a completed flag, but the user explicitly requested only a visible title field.)

5. Validation Rules
- Title is required and must not be empty.

6. Offline Use
- The app must work offline in the browser (no internet required for core functionality).

7. Data Backup / Export
- Not specified by the user. (No explicit requirement for backup/export was given.)

8. Other Expectations
- No additional accessibility or installation requirements were specified.

Notes:
- The user confirmed they had provided enough information and requested the final files to be generated.
