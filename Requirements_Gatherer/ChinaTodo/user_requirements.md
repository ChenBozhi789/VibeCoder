# ChinaTodo — User Requirements

## App Name
- ChinaTodo

## Purpose
- A simple personal to-do list app for managing individual tasks quickly on Desktop.

## Target Users
- Individuals who want a minimal desktop to-do app for capturing and managing single-line tasks.

## Core Features (requested)
- Add tasks (create)
- Edit tasks (update)
- Delete tasks (remove)

> Note: The user explicitly chose a very minimal feature set (only add/edit/delete). No due dates, reminders, tags, subtasks, or attachments were requested.

## UI Preferences
- Layout: Simple list (one-column list of tasks with the title). Compact and focused on quick task capture and management.
- Primary platform: Desktop

## Task Fields (data to store)
- Title (single-line) — REQUIRED (user selected "A")

> Implementation note: For robustness, the app will also include internal metadata (id, timestamps) managed by the app but not required or editable by the user.

## Validation Rules
- Title is required and must not be empty.
- Title max length: 200 characters (implementation suggestion).

## Persistence & Backup
- Data stays local in the browser (local-first). The user did not request import/export or cloud sync.
- Since the user did not request backup/export explicitly, the plan will recommend a simple JSON export/import as an optional enhancement.

## Non-functional Requirements (high-level)
- Fast startup and snappy list interactions on desktop browsers.
- Offline-capable: app should work without network access (all data local).
- Accessibility: keyboard-navigable and screen-reader friendly where practical.

## Open / Ambiguous Items (QA note)
- The user did not confirm whether they want a local backup/export (download/upload JSON) or an installable PWA. These were offered earlier but not selected. If the user wants these later, they can be added as optional features.
